      <p>Tic Tac Toe used to require a pen/pencil and some paper <span>(unless if you are being a silly little person and doing it on a table or wall)</span> but now, you don't need paper. You don't even need a pen/pencil! Instead, you can go against your friend using this website. If you do not have friends, wait for the next <span>(not guaranteed)</span> update where I manage to code the ANN (Ann Anon) I'm working on and apply one copy here. This is the first one I'm going to AI-ify <span>(if this is updated)</span> so this is something you can be excited for.</p>
