      <p>This is Rock Paper Scissors. In this webpage of my <span>(going to be)</span> giant website, you can go against the computer. You can pick Rock, Paper or Scissors and if you choose the same as your opponent, you draw. If you chose Rock and the computer randomly <span>(yes, it is random: this isn't rigged)</span> selects Paper, you lose and the computer wins but if Scissors was chosen by the opponent, you win and it loses. Paper also loses to Scissors. If you are wondering why you can't go against a friend, you're dumb. In a future update, you can expect personalities but not guaranteed.</p>
